## Fire
Using the basic mechanics of the classic [Skud Pai Sho](https://skudpaisho.com/site/games/skud-pai-sho/), Fire is a game that combines chance and skill to keep players at the edge of their seat. The board setup and play are reminiscent of the famous Pai Sho scene of The Desert in ATLA, and the ranomization aspect was inspired by the comments made in the show about Pai Sho as a game that is gambled on. In addition to designing this game, I programmed a playable version for The Garden Gate, borrowing heavily from existing Skud Pai Sho code.
